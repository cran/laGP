updates for JSS article

changed to VT contact information

added mixed constraints demos from Picheny et al. paper
and changed some optim.auglag defaults to match those
used for the figures in the paper

Fixed checking of end versus nrow(X) which was leading
to a segfault in low nrow(X) examples; thanks to Jakob 
Richter for the bug report

updates to optim.auglag for slack variables implementation
and mixed equality and inequality constraints


1.2-1 (18 Sept 2015)
-----

Fixed assert errors in gp_sep.cc for Windows build


1.2 (10 Sept 2015)

vignette accepted at JSS -- includes latest modifications

changed my to MY for myprintf, etc., for Brian

initial C-version of optim via lbfgsb with OpenMP critical
pragmas, accompanying laGPsep and aGPsep functions for
local modeling with a separable correlation (beta)

implementation of EIC for optimization (Schonlau, etal, 1998)

alpha implementation of AL optimization by slack variables


1.1-5 (22 May 2015)
-----

New vignette from JSS revisions

swapped sum_of_columns for min_of_columns in multi-row
Xref case for laGP

Documentation enhancements and update for JSS/vignette
resubmission

Option to use separable GP model in optim.auglag.

Option to model objective in optim.auglag rather than 
assuming a known scaled linear objective

corrected three abs to fabs in matrix.c

corrected one more hard-code of 8 threads in vignette

added vignette("laGP") to most seealso sections in Rd
