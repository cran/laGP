1.1-5 (22 May 2015)
-----

New vignette from JSS revisions

swapped sum_of_columns for min_of_columns in multi-row
Xref case for laGP

Documentation enhancements and update for JSS/vignette
resubmission

Option to use separable GP model in optim.auglag.

Option to model objective in optim.auglag rather than 
assuming a known scaled linear objective 


1.1-4 (02 Dec 2014)
-----

added predGPsep to predict with separable GPs

corrected three abs to fabs in matrix.c

corrected one more hard-code of 8 threads in vignette

added vignette("laGP") to most seealso sections in Rd

fixes to vignette for JSS pre-screening

removed calc.eis because C-implementation was not in src; 
can use version from plgp package instead


1.1-3 (30 Oct 2014)
-----

fixed assert(gp) in gp_sep.c

added code to max-out omp.threads and gpu.threads at the
OpenMP max in the system configuration

changed vignette to default to two threads unless env
specifies a different OMP_NUM_THREADS


1.1-2 (16 Oct 2014)
-----

added separable GP (GPsep) for finding MLE separable
lengthscale parameters for scaling isotropic versions

ported calib functions over to package with documentation
and examples

added first pass at vignette


1.1-1 (02 Sept 2014)
-----

avoid re-calulating derivative info when optimizing over
the nugget

moved several Suggests to Depends for R CHECK

submitted rays paper and added to references

now beta ray-based search including option to control the
number of rays

now outputting close in object to inspect fidelity of
search


1.1 (20 March 2014)
---

added ray-based search for faster greedy local design
(alpha functionality)

added functions for optimization under constraints by
the augmented Lagrangian (alpha functionality)

minor bug fixes and documentation updates

removed snow; only supporting parallel now
